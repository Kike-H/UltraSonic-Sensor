## Dependencies

You need the next tools:

### Backend 
1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
2. [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

The last is opcional but we recommend to use a virtual environment.
We are use virtualenv for python 3 you can install with the next line:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
or

```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```
